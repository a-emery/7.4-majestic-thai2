This app is one of my prouder assignments. It This app was a bit of a challenge. For this project, I built a restaurant app that allows you to add and remove menu items, submit and order, and send that order information to Parse where it could be fetched by a restaurant who would fulfill the order. As items are added or removed, the total is calculated and rerendered. The hardest part was probably creating the submit order function. It is not a very difficult function, but it took me a minute to figure out what exactly I needed to do to combine all of the menu items into an array and send the data to a back-end source. When submitted, the order, time, and total cost of the order get sent to Parse.
